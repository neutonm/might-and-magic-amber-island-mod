1	Warder	2000	500	500	The Warder can cover you in combat, great at taking hits but not so strong in offense. He's there to protect you while you destroy your enemies.	The Warder is now at your beck and call. He'll stand as a bulwark between you and your foes. Use him wisely.	Just so you know, I might not hit hard, but I can take a beating while you lot do the damage from behind me.	I'm too tired, boss.		Off I go then. If you need me, I'll be at the merc guild, probably just standing around.	I was worried for a bit, boss.
2	Ratman	0	0	0	Our newest recruit. Not the strongest fighter you'll find, but he's got a knack for slipping out of the tightest spots. He's sneaky, quick, and has an uncanny ability to dodge death.	Consider it done. The Ratman is yours. He's eager to prove himself - just keep an eye on him in battle. He'll surprise you.	Hey there, friends! Ratman at your service. Sneaky, sneaky - that's me. But don't worry, I've got your back... in my own special way.	Phew, I'm all tuckered out. Using my tricks really takes it out of me. Mind if I take a little breather before the next round of mischief?	"Undying"\nPassive Ability:\n\nRatman's special ability prevents him from dying. Instead, when he would normally die, one summoner charge is consumed. \n\nHe will return to the party upon death.	Getting the boot, am I? Fair enough, fair enough. Can't say it's been boring! If you ever need a bit of sneaky again, you know where to find me.	Ah, changing our minds, are we? Can't say I blame you...
