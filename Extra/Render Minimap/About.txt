Here's my stuff for MM8 minimaps rendering and post-processing.
Put "Ground Override" from Data into Data folder of your game. This will replace water and lava textures on Export with minimap-friendly ones.

In Blender:
 minimap.blend - for Ravenshore
 minimap desert.blend - for Ironsand and Shadowspire
 File - Import - Wavefront (.obj)
  Set "Clamp Size" to 100
 Select ground (with right mouse button) and press Smooth under Shading on the left (in default layout) panel.
 Render and save.
 Delete the ground and do render just with objects, save the result to a file.
 
Next, post-processing. I did it in a Russian version of Corel Photo-Paint and now I want to convert the process into GIMP. Images in this folder are all related to post-processing.


Yours,
 Sergey "GrayFace" Rozhenko
